# World_Height_Stats.py
Practice project in data analysis: calculating mean, min, and max heights across countries with Pandas.
This script demonstrates a simple data analysis workflow using Python (Pandas).
The dataset contains average male and female heights by country (2022).

Features:

Displays first rows of the dataset for quick inspection

Computes descriptive statistics (mean, min, max) for both genders

Filters and shows height data for a chosen country (Mexico)

This project is part of my learning path in data analysis and serves as an example of using Python for exploratory data analysis.
